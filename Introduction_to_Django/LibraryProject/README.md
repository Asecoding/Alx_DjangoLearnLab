# introduction of python

Welcome to the “Introduction to Django” project. This project is tailored for you to help you gain hands-on experience with Django, one of the most popular web frameworks for building robust web applications. Throughout this project, you will set up a Django development environment, learn about Django models and ORM, and explore the Django admin interface.

# Objectives

## Set Up Django Development Environment:


Install Django and create a new Django project.
Familiarize yourself with the project’s default structure and run the development server.
Implementing and Interacting with Django Models:

## Create a Django app.

Define Django models with specified attributes.
Perform and document CRUD operations using Django’s ORM via the Django shell.
# Utilizing the Django Admin Interface:

Register your models with the Django admin.
Customize the admin interface to enhance the management and visibility of your data.
Objective: Gain familiarity with Django by setting up a Django development environment and creating a basic Django project. This task aims to introduce you to the workflow of Django projects, including project creation and running the development server.

# Task Description:

Install Django and create a new Django project named LibraryProject. This initial setup will serve as the foundation for developing Django applications. You’ll also explore the project’s default structure to understand the roles of various components.

# Steps:

Install Django:

Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Install Django using pip: pip install django.
Create Your Django Project:

Create a new Django project by running: django-admin startproject LibraryProject.
Run the Development Server:

Navigate into your project directory (cd LibraryProject).
Create a README.md file inside the LibraryProject.
Start the development server using: python manage.py runserver.
Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the default Django welcome page.
Explore the Project Structure:

Familiarize yourself with the created project structure. Pay particular attention to:
settings.py: Configuration for the Django project.
urls.py: The URL declarations for the project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site.
manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project
